##### QUESTION:

-   provide code for implementing a progress spinner with the logic to terminate when loading is finished, Using typescript! Thank you!

##### ChatGPT

-   Certainly! Below is an example of how you can implement a progress spinner in TypeScript along with logic to terminate when loading is finished:

-   TypeScript code:

```typescript
class ProgressSpinner {
	private intervalId: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
	private isLoading: boolean = false;

	startLoading(): void {
		if (this.isLoading) return;

		this.isLoading = true;
		this.intervalId = setInterval(() => this.showSpinner(), 100);
	}

	stopLoading(): void {
		if (!this.isLoading) return;

		if (this.intervalId) {
			clearInterval(this.intervalId);
			this.intervalId = null;
			this.isLoading = false;
			this.clearSpinner();
		}
	}

	private showSpinner(): void {
		process.stdout.write('\r- Loading   ');
		process.stdout.write('\r\\ Loading   ');
		process.stdout.write('\r| Loading   ');
		process.stdout.write('\r/ Loading   ');
	}

	private clearSpinner(): void {
		process.stdout.clearLine(0);
		process.stdout.cursorTo(0);
		process.stdout.write('- Loading Complete\n');
	}
}

// Example usage
const spinner = new ProgressSpinner();

// Simulate a task that takes 5 seconds to complete
spinner.startLoading();
setTimeout(() => {
	spinner.stopLoading();
}, 5000);
```

-   This code creates a ProgressSpinner class with methods to start and stop the spinner. The spinner animation is achieved by writing to the standard output (process.stdout). The startLoading() method starts the spinner animation by setting an interval, and the stopLoading() method stops the spinner animation by clearing the interval and displaying a completion message.

-   In the example usage at the bottom, we create an instance of ProgressSpinner, start the spinner, simulate a task that takes 5 seconds to complete using setTimeout(), and then stop the spinner once the task is done.

##### User

-   Great, thank you. Can you provide this for the frontend client side ?

##### ChatGPT

-   Certainly! Here's how you can implement a progress spinner with logic to terminate when loading is finished using TypeScript for a frontend client-side application:

-TypeScript

```typescript
class ProgressSpinner {
	private spinnerElement: HTMLElement | null = null;
	private isLoading: boolean = false;

	constructor(private containerId: string) {
		this.spinnerElement = document.createElement('div');
		this.spinnerElement.innerHTML = `
            <div id="spinner" style="display: none;">
                <div class="spinner"></div>
                <div class="loading-text">Loading...</div>
            </div>
        `;
		document
			.getElementById(this.containerId)
			?.appendChild(this.spinnerElement);
	}

	startLoading(): void {
		if (this.isLoading || !this.spinnerElement) return;

		this.isLoading = true;
		this.spinnerElement.style.display = 'block';
	}

	stopLoading(): void {
		if (!this.isLoading || !this.spinnerElement) return;

		this.isLoading = false;
		this.spinnerElement.style.display = 'none';
	}
}

// Example usage
const spinner = new ProgressSpinner('app');

// Simulate a task that takes 5 seconds to complete
spinner.startLoading();
setTimeout(() => {
	spinner.stopLoading();
}, 5000);
```

-   In this code, we create a ProgressSpinner class that manages a spinner element within a container specified by its ID. The startLoading() method displays the spinner element, and the stopLoading() method hides the spinner element.

-   To use the ProgressSpinner class:

-   Create an instance of ProgressSpinner, passing the ID of the container where you want the spinner to appear.
    Call startLoading() to display the spinner when loading starts.
    Call stopLoading() to hide the spinner when loading is finished.
    You can style the spinner using CSS to customize its appearance according to your needs.

##### User

-   Perfect, thank you! yOU ARE WONDERFUL!

##### ChatGPT

-   You're very welcome! I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!

##### QUESTION:

-   Can you use this same format, but using a function instead of a class, because I am going to use this as a method within a class?

##### ChatGPT

-   Certainly! Here's the equivalent functionality implemented using a function instead of a class:

-   TypeScript

```typescript
function progressSpinner(containerId: string) {
	let spinnerElement: HTMLElement | null = null;
	let isLoading: boolean = false;

	function startLoading(): void {
		if (isLoading || !spinnerElement) return;

		isLoading = true;
		spinnerElement.style.display = 'block';
	}

	function stopLoading(): void {
		if (!isLoading || !spinnerElement) return;

		isLoading = false;
		spinnerElement.style.display = 'none';
	}

	// Initialize spinner element
	spinnerElement = document.createElement('div');
	spinnerElement.innerHTML = `
        <div id="spinner" style="display: none;">
            <div class="spinner"></div>
            <div class="loading-text">Loading...</div>
        </div>
    `;
	document.getElementById(containerId)?.appendChild(spinnerElement);

	return {
		startLoading,
		stopLoading
	};
}

// Example usage
const spinner = progressSpinner('app');

// Simulate a task that takes 5 seconds to complete
spinner.startLoading();
setTimeout(() => {
	spinner.stopLoading();
}, 5000);
```

-   In this implementation, progressSpinner is a function that creates and manages the spinner functionality within the specified container. It returns an object containing the startLoading and stopLoading functions, which allow you to control the spinner from outside.

-   You can use this progressSpinner function as a method within your class or any other context where you need to manage loading spinners.

### **Using templates and slots**

-   This article explains how you can use the template and slot elements to create a flexible template that can then be used to populate the shadow DOM of a web component.

#### The truth about templates

-   When you have to reuse the same markup structures repeatedly on a web page, it makes sense to use some kind of a template rather than repeating the same structure over and over again. This was possible before, but it is made a lot easier by the HTML template element. This element and its contents are not rendered in the DOM, but it can still be referenced using JavaScript.

##### **Let's look at a trivial quick example:**

-   HTML

```html
<template id="my-paragraph">
	<p>My paragraph</p>
</template>
```

-   This won't appear in your page until you grab a reference to it with JavaScript and then append it to the DOM, using something like the following:

-   JS

```javascript
let template = document.getElementById('my-paragraph');
let templateContent = template.content;
document.body.appendChild(templateContent);
```

-   Although trivial, you can already start to see how this could be useful.

#### Using templates with web components

-   Templates are useful on their own, but they work even better with web components. Let's define a web component that uses our template as the content of its shadow DOM. We'll call it my-paragraph as well:

-   JS

```javascript
customElements.define(
	'my-paragraph',
	class extends HTMLElement {
		constructor() {
			super();
			let template = document.getElementById('my-paragraph');
			let templateContent = template.content;

			const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
			shadowRoot.appendChild(templateContent.cloneNode(true));
		}
	}
);
```

-   The key point to note here is that we append a clone of the template content to the shadow root, created using the Node.cloneNode() method.

-   And because we are appending its contents to a shadow DOM, we can include some styling information inside the template in a style element, which is then encapsulated inside the custom element. This wouldn't work if we just appended it to the standard DOM.

-   So for example:

-   HTML

```html
<template id="my-paragraph">
	<style>
		p {
			color: white;
			background-color: #666;
			padding: 5px;
		}
	</style>
	<p>My paragraph</p>
</template>
```

-   Now we can use it by just adding it to our HTML document:

-   HTML

```html
<my-paragraph></my-paragraph>
```

#### Adding flexibility with slots

-   So far so good, but the element isn't very flexible. We can only display one bit of text inside it, meaning that at the moment it is even less useful than a regular paragraph! We can make it possible to display different text in each element instance in a nice declarative way using the slot element.

-   Slots are identified by their name attribute, and allow you to define placeholders in your template that can be filled with any markup fragment you want when the element is used in the markup.

-   So, if we want to add a slot into our trivial example, we could update our template's paragraph element like this:

-   HTML

```html
<p><slot name="my-text">My default text</slot></p>
```

-   If the slot's content isn't defined when the element is included in the markup, or if the browser doesn't support slots, my-paragraph just contains the fallback content "My default text".

-   To define the slot's content, we include an HTML structure inside the my-paragraph element with a slot attribute whose value is equal to the name of the slot we want it to fill. As before, this can be anything you like, for example:

-   HTML

```html
<my-paragraph>
	<span slot="my-text">Let's have some different text!</span>
</my-paragraph>
```

or

-   HTML

```html
<my-paragraph>
	<ul slot="my-text">
		<li>Let's have some different text!</li>
		<li>In a list!</li>
	</ul>
</my-paragraph>
```

-   **Note:** Nodes that can be inserted into slots are known as Slottable nodes; when a node has been inserted in a slot, it is said to be slotted.

-   **Note:** An unnamed slot will be filled with all of the custom element's top-level child nodes that do not have the slot attribute. This includes text nodes.

-   And that's it for our trivial example. If you want to play with it some more, you can find it on GitHub (see it running live also).

#### A more involved example

-   To finish off the article, let's look at something a little less trivial.

-   The following set of code snippets show how to use <slot> together with template and some JavaScript to:

-   create a element-details element with named slots in its shadow root
    design the element-details element in such a way that, when used in documents, it is rendered from composing the element's content together with content from its shadow root—that is, pieces of the element's content are used to fill in named slots in its shadow root

**Note:** that it is technically possible to use slot element without a template element, e.g., within say a regular div element, and still take advantage of the place-holder features of slot for Shadow DOM content, and doing so may indeed avoid the small trouble of needing to first access the template element's content property (and clone it). However, it is generally more practical to add slots within a template element, since you are unlikely to need to define a pattern based on an already-rendered element.

-   In addition, even if it is not already rendered, the purpose of the container as a template should be more semantically clear when using the template. In addition, template can have items directly added to it, like td>, which would disappear when added to a div.

-   **Note:** You can find this complete example at element-details (see it running live also).

#### Creating a template with some slots

-   First of all, we use the slot> element within a template> element to create a new "element-details-template" document fragment containing some named slots:

-   HTML

```html
<template id="element-details-template">
	<style>
		details {
			font-family: 'Open Sans Light', Helvetica, Arial;
		}
		.name {
			font-weight: bold;
			color: #217ac0;
			font-size: 120%;
		}
		h4 {
			margin: 10px 0 -8px 0;
		}
		h4 span {
			background: #217ac0;
			padding: 2px 6px 2px 6px;
		}
		h4 span {
			border: 1px solid #cee9f9;
			border-radius: 4px;
		}
		h4 span {
			color: white;
		}
		.attributes {
			margin-left: 22px;
			font-size: 90%;
		}
		.attributes p {
			margin-left: 16px;
			font-style: italic;
		}
	</style>
	<details>
		<summary>
			<span>
				<code class="name"
					>&lt;<slot name="element-name">NEED NAME</slot>&gt;</code
				>
				<span class="desc"
					><slot name="description">NEED DESCRIPTION</slot></span
				>
			</span>
		</summary>
		<div class="attributes">
			<h4><span>Attributes</span></h4>
			<slot name="attributes"><p>None</p></slot>
		</div>
	</details>
	<hr />
</template>
```

-   That template> element has several features:

-   The template> has a style> element with a set of CSS styles that are scoped just to the document fragment the template> creates.

-   The template> uses slot> and its name attribute to make three named slots:

```html
<slot name="element-name">
	<slot name="description"> <slot name="attributes"></slot></slot
></slot>
```

-   The template> wraps the named slots in a details> element.
    Creating a new element-details> element from the template>

-   Next, let's create a new custom element named element-details> and use Element.attachShadow to attach to it, as its shadow root, that document fragment we created with our template> element above. This uses exactly the same pattern as we saw in our earlier trivial example.

-   JS

```javascript
customElements.define(
	'element-details',
	class extends HTMLElement {
		constructor() {
			super();
			const template = document.getElementById(
				'element-details-template'
			).content;
			const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
			shadowRoot.appendChild(template.cloneNode(true));
		}
	}
);
```

-   Using the element-details> custom element with named slots
    Now let's take that element-details> element and actually use it in our document:

-   HTML

```html
<element-details>
	<span slot="element-name">slot</span>
	<span slot="description"
		>A placeholder inside a web component that users can fill with their own
		markup, with the effect of composing different DOM trees together.</span
	>
	<dl slot="attributes">
		<dt>name</dt>
		<dd>The name of the slot.</dd>
	</dl>
</element-details>

<element-details>
	<span slot="element-name">template</span>
	<span slot="description"
		>A mechanism for holding client- side content that is not to be rendered
		when a page is loaded but may subsequently be instantiated during
		runtime using JavaScript.</span
	>
</element-details>
```

-   About that snippet, notice these points:

-   The snippet has two instances of element-details> elements which both use the slot attribute to reference the named slots "element-name" and "description" we put in the element-details> shadow root .
-   Only the first of those two element-details> elements references the "attributes" named slot. The second element-details> element lacks any reference to the "attributes" named slot.
-   The first element-details> element references the "attributes" named slot using a dl> element with dt> and dd> children.
    Adding a final bit of style
-   As a finishing touch, we'll add a tiny bit more CSS for the dl>, dt>, and dd> elements in our doc:

-   CSS

```css
dl {
	margin-left: 6px;
}
dt {
	color: #217ac0;
	font-family: Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Courier;
	font-size: 110%;
	font-weight: bold;
}
dd {
	margin-left: 16px;
}
```

#### **Result:**

-   Finally let's put all the snippets together and see what the rendered result looks like.

-   **Notice the following points about this rendered result:**

-   Even though the instances of the element-details> element in the document do not directly use the details> element, they get rendered using details> because the shadow root causes them to get populated with that.
-   Within the rendered details> output, the content in the element-details> elements fills the named slots from the shadow root. In other words, the DOM tree from the element-details> elements get composed together with the content of the shadow root.
-   For both element-details> elements, an Attributes heading gets automatically added from the shadow root before the position of the "attributes" named slot.
-   Because the first element-details> has a dl> element which explicitly references the "attributes" named slot from its shadow root, the contents of that dl> replace the "attributes" named slot from the shadow root.
-   Because the second element-details> doesn't explicitly reference the "attributes" named slot from its shadow root, its content for that named slot gets filled with the default content for it from the shadow root.
