[![NPM Version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/express-session)](https://npmjs.org/package/express-session) [![NPM Downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dm/express-session)](https://nodejs.org/en/download) [![Build Status](https://badgen.net/github/checks/expressjs/session/master?label=ci)](https://github.com/expressjs/session/actions?query=workflow%3Aci) [![Test Coverage](https://badgen.net/coveralls/c/github/expressjs/session/master)](https://coveralls.io/r/expressjs/session?branch=master)

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install express-session
```

## API

```javascript
var session = require('express-session');
```

### session(options)

Create a session middleware with the given `options`.

**Note** Session data is _not_ saved in the cookie itself, just the session ID. Session data is stored server-side.

**Note** Since version 1.5.0, the [`cookie-parser` middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser) no longer needs to be used for this module to work. This module now directly reads and writes cookies on `req`/`res`. Using `cookie-parser` may result in issues if the `secret` is not the same between this module and `cookie-parser`.

**Warning** The default server-side session storage, `MemoryStore`, is _purposely_ not designed for a production environment. It will leak memory under most conditions, does not scale past a single process, and is meant for debugging and developing.

For a list of stores, see [compatible session stores](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#compatible-session-stores).

#### Options

`express-session` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### cookie

Settings object for the session ID cookie. The default value is `{ path: '/', httpOnly: true, secure: false, maxAge: null }`.

The following are options that can be set in this object.

##### cookie.domain

Specifies the value for the `Domain` `Set-Cookie` attribute. By default, no domain is set, and most clients will consider the cookie to apply to only the current domain.

##### cookie.expires

Specifies the `Date` object to be the value for the `Expires` `Set-Cookie` attribute. By default, no expiration is set, and most clients will consider this a “non-persistent cookie” and will delete it on a condition like exiting a web browser application.

**Note** If both `expires` and `maxAge` are set in the options, then the last one defined in the object is what is used.

**Note** The `expires` option should not be set directly; instead only use the `maxAge` option.

##### cookie.httpOnly

Specifies the `boolean` value for the `HttpOnly` `Set-Cookie` attribute. When truthy, the `HttpOnly` attribute is set, otherwise it is not. By default, the `HttpOnly` attribute is set.

**Note** be careful when setting this to `true`, as compliant clients will not allow client-side JavaScript to see the cookie in `document.cookie`.

##### cookie.maxAge

Specifies the `number` (in milliseconds) to use when calculating the `Expires` `Set-Cookie` attribute. This is done by taking the current server time and adding `maxAge` milliseconds to the value to calculate an `Expires` datetime. By default, no maximum age is set.

**Note** If both `expires` and `maxAge` are set in the options, then the last one defined in the object is what is used.

##### cookie.path

Specifies the value for the `Path` `Set-Cookie`. By default, this is set to `'/'`, which is the root path of the domain.

##### cookie.sameSite

Specifies the `boolean` or `string` to be the value for the `SameSite` `Set-Cookie` attribute. By default, this is `false`.

-   `true` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` for strict same site enforcement.
-   `false` will not set the `SameSite` attribute.
-   `'lax'` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `Lax` for lax same site enforcement.
-   `'none'` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `None` for an explicit cross-site cookie.
-   `'strict'` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` for strict same site enforcement.

More information about the different enforcement levels can be found in [the specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-4.1.2.7).

**Note** This is an attribute that has not yet been fully standardized, and may change in the future. This also means many clients may ignore this attribute until they understand it.

**Note** There is a [draft spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-01) that requires that the `Secure` attribute be set to `true` when the `SameSite` attribute has been set to `'none'`. Some web browsers or other clients may be adopting this specification.

##### cookie.secure

Specifies the `boolean` value for the `Secure` `Set-Cookie` attribute. When truthy, the `Secure` attribute is set, otherwise it is not. By default, the `Secure` attribute is not set.

**Note** be careful when setting this to `true`, as compliant clients will not send the cookie back to the server in the future if the browser does not have an HTTPS connection.

Please note that `secure: true` is a **recommended** option. However, it requires an https-enabled website, i.e., HTTPS is necessary for secure cookies. If `secure` is set, and you access your site over HTTP, the cookie will not be set. If you have your node.js behind a proxy and are using `secure: true`, you need to set “trust proxy” in express:

```javascript
var app = express();
app.set('trust proxy', 1); // trust first proxy
app.use(
    session({
        secret: 'keyboard cat',
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: true,
        cookie: { secure: true }
    })
);
```

For using secure cookies in production, but allowing for testing in development, the following is an example of enabling this setup based on `NODE_ENV` in express:

```javascript
var app = express();
var sess = {
    secret: 'keyboard cat',
    cookie: {}
};

if (app.get('env') === 'production') {
    app.set('trust proxy', 1); // trust first proxy
    sess.cookie.secure = true; // serve secure cookies
}

app.use(session(sess));
```

The `cookie.secure` option can also be set to the special value `'auto'` to have this setting automatically match the determined security of the connection. Be careful when using this setting if the site is available both as HTTP and HTTPS, as once the cookie is set on HTTPS, it will no longer be visible over HTTP. This is useful when the Express `"trust proxy"` setting is properly setup to simplify development vs production configuration.

##### genid

Function to call to generate a new session ID. Provide a function that returns a string that will be used as a session ID. The function is given `req` as the first argument if you want to use some value attached to `req` when generating the ID.

The default value is a function which uses the `uid-safe` library to generate IDs.

**NOTE** be careful to generate unique IDs so your sessions do not conflict.

```javascript
app.use(
    session({
        genid: function (req) {
            return genuuid(); // use UUIDs for session IDs
        },
        secret: 'keyboard cat'
    })
);
```

##### name

The name of the session ID cookie to set in the response (and read from in the request).

The default value is `'connect.sid'`.

**Note** if you have multiple apps running on the same hostname (this is just the name, i.e. `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`; different schemes and ports do not name a different hostname), then you need to separate the session cookies from each other. The simplest method is to simply set different `name`s per app.

##### proxy

Trust the reverse proxy when setting secure cookies (via the “X-Forwarded-Proto” header).

The default value is `undefined`.

-   `true` The “X-Forwarded-Proto” header will be used.
-   `false` All headers are ignored and the connection is considered secure only if there is a direct TLS/SSL connection.
-   `undefined` Uses the “trust proxy” setting from express

##### resave

Forces the session to be saved back to the session store, even if the session was never modified during the request. Depending on your store this may be necessary, but it can also create race conditions where a client makes two parallel requests to your server and changes made to the session in one request may get overwritten when the other request ends, even if it made no changes (this behavior also depends on what store you’re using).

The default value is `true`, but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case. Typically, you’ll want `false`.

How do I know if this is necessary for my store? The best way to know is to check with your store if it implements the `touch` method. If it does, then you can safely set `resave: false`. If it does not implement the `touch` method and your store sets an expiration date on stored sessions, then you likely need `resave: true`.

##### rolling

Force the session identifier cookie to be set on every response. The expiration is reset to the original [`maxAge`](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#cookiemaxage), resetting the expiration countdown.

The default value is `false`.

With this enabled, the session identifier cookie will expire in [`maxAge`](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#cookiemaxage) since the last response was sent instead of in [`maxAge`](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#cookiemaxage) since the session was last modified by the server.

This is typically used in conjuction with short, non-session-length [`maxAge`](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#cookiemaxage) values to provide a quick timeout of the session data with reduced potential of it occurring during on going server interactions.

**Note** When this option is set to `true` but the `saveUninitialized` option is set to `false`, the cookie will not be set on a response with an uninitialized session. This option only modifies the behavior when an existing session was loaded for the request.

##### saveUninitialized

Forces a session that is “uninitialized” to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing `false` is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing `false` will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.

The default value is `true`, but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future. Please research into this setting and choose what is appropriate to your use-case.

**Note** if you are using Session in conjunction with PassportJS, Passport will add an empty Passport object to the session for use after a user is authenticated, which will be treated as a modification to the session, causing it to be saved. _This has been fixed in PassportJS 0.3.0_

##### secret

**Required option**

This is the secret used to sign the session ID cookie. This can be either a string for a single secret, or an array of multiple secrets. If an array of secrets is provided, only the first element will be used to sign the session ID cookie, while all the elements will be considered when verifying the signature in requests. The secret itself should be not easily parsed by a human and would best be a random set of characters. A best practice may include:

-   The use of environment variables to store the secret, ensuring the secret itself does not exist in your repository.
-   Periodic updates of the secret, while ensuring the previous secret is in the array.

Using a secret that cannot be guessed will reduce the ability to hijack a session to only guessing the session ID (as determined by the `genid` option).

Changing the secret value will invalidate all existing sessions. In order to rotate the secret without invalidating sessions, provide an array of secrets, with the new secret as first element of the array, and including previous secrets as the later elements.

##### store

The session store instance, defaults to a new `MemoryStore` instance.

##### unset

Control the result of unsetting `req.session` (through `delete`, setting to `null`, etc.).

The default value is `'keep'`.

-   `'destroy'` The session will be destroyed (deleted) when the response ends.
-   `'keep'` The session in the store will be kept, but modifications made during the request are ignored and not saved.

### req.session

To store or access session data, simply use the request property `req.session`, which is (generally) serialized as JSON by the store, so nested objects are typically fine. For example below is a user-specific view counter:

```javascript
// Use the session middleware
app.use(session({ secret: 'keyboard cat', cookie: { maxAge: 60000 } }));

// Access the session as req.session
app.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.session.views) {
        req.session.views++;
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
        res.write('<p>views: ' + req.session.views + '</p>');
        res.write(
            '<p>expires in: ' + req.session.cookie.maxAge / 1000 + 's</p>'
        );
        res.end();
    } else {
        req.session.views = 1;
        res.end('welcome to the session demo. refresh!');
    }
});
```

#### Session.regenerate(callback)

To regenerate the session simply invoke the method. Once complete, a new SID and `Session` instance will be initialized at `req.session` and the `callback` will be invoked.

```javascript
req.session.regenerate(function (err) {
    // will have a new session here
});
```

#### Session.destroy(callback)

Destroys the session and will unset the `req.session` property. Once complete, the `callback` will be invoked.

```javascript
req.session.destroy(function (err) {
    // cannot access session here
});
```

#### Session.reload(callback)

Reloads the session data from the store and re-populates the `req.session` object. Once complete, the `callback` will be invoked.

```javascript
req.session.reload(function (err) {
    // session updated
});
```

#### Session.save(callback)

Save the session back to the store, replacing the contents on the store with the contents in memory (though a store may do something else–consult the store’s documentation for exact behavior).

This method is automatically called at the end of the HTTP response if the session data has been altered (though this behavior can be altered with various options in the middleware constructor). Because of this, typically this method does not need to be called.

There are some cases where it is useful to call this method, for example, redirects, long-lived requests or in WebSockets.

```javascript
req.session.save(function (err) {
    // session saved
});
```

#### Session.touch()

Updates the `.maxAge` property. Typically this is not necessary to call, as the session middleware does this for you.

### req.session.id

Each session has a unique ID associated with it. This property is an alias of [`req.sessionID`](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#reqsessionid-1) and cannot be modified. It has been added to make the session ID accessible from the `session` object.

### req.session.cookie

Each session has a unique cookie object accompany it. This allows you to alter the session cookie per visitor. For example we can set `req.session.cookie.expires` to `false` to enable the cookie to remain for only the duration of the user-agent.

#### Cookie.maxAge

Alternatively `req.session.cookie.maxAge` will return the time remaining in milliseconds, which we may also re-assign a new value to adjust the `.expires` property appropriately. The following are essentially equivalent

```javascript
var hour = 3600000;
req.session.cookie.expires = new Date(Date.now() + hour);
req.session.cookie.maxAge = hour;
```

For example when `maxAge` is set to `60000` (one minute), and 30 seconds has elapsed it will return `30000` until the current request has completed, at which time `req.session.touch()` is called to reset `req.session.cookie.maxAge` to its original value.

```javascript
req.session.cookie.maxAge; // => 30000
```

#### Cookie.originalMaxAge

The `req.session.cookie.originalMaxAge` property returns the original `maxAge` (time-to-live), in milliseconds, of the session cookie.

### req.sessionID

To get the ID of the loaded session, access the request property `req.sessionID`. This is simply a read-only value set when a session is loaded/created.

## Session Store Implementation

Every session store _must_ be an `EventEmitter` and implement specific methods. The following methods are the list of **required**, **recommended**, and **optional**.

-   Required methods are ones that this module will always call on the store.
-   Recommended methods are ones that this module will call on the store if available.
-   Optional methods are ones this module does not call at all, but helps present uniform stores to users.

For an example implementation view the [connect-redis](http://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis) repo.

### store.all(callback)

**Optional**

This optional method is used to get all sessions in the store as an array. The `callback` should be called as `callback(error, sessions)`.

### store.destroy(sid, callback)

**Required**

This required method is used to destroy/delete a session from the store given a session ID (`sid`). The `callback` should be called as `callback(error)` once the session is destroyed.

### store.clear(callback)

**Optional**

This optional method is used to delete all sessions from the store. The `callback` should be called as `callback(error)` once the store is cleared.

### store.length(callback)

**Optional**

This optional method is used to get the count of all sessions in the store. The `callback` should be called as `callback(error, len)`.

### store.get(sid, callback)

**Required**

This required method is used to get a session from the store given a session ID (`sid`). The `callback` should be called as `callback(error, session)`.

The `session` argument should be a session if found, otherwise `null` or `undefined` if the session was not found (and there was no error). A special case is made when `error.code === 'ENOENT'` to act like `callback(null, null)`.

### store.set(sid, session, callback)

**Required**

This required method is used to upsert a session into the store given a session ID (`sid`) and session (`session`) object. The callback should be called as `callback(error)` once the session has been set in the store.

### store.touch(sid, session, callback)

**Recommended**

This recommended method is used to “touch” a given session given a session ID (`sid`) and session (`session`) object. The `callback` should be called as `callback(error)` once the session has been touched.

This is primarily used when the store will automatically delete idle sessions and this method is used to signal to the store the given session is active, potentially resetting the idle timer.

## Examples

### View counter

A simple example using `express-session` to store page views for a user.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var parseurl = require('parseurl');
var session = require('express-session');

var app = express();

app.use(
    session({
        secret: 'keyboard cat',
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: true
    })
);

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
    if (!req.session.views) {
        req.session.views = {};
    }

    // get the url pathname
    var pathname = parseurl(req).pathname;

    // count the views
    req.session.views[pathname] = (req.session.views[pathname] || 0) + 1;

    next();
});

app.get('/foo', function (req, res, next) {
    res.send('you viewed this page ' + req.session.views['/foo'] + ' times');
});

app.get('/bar', function (req, res, next) {
    res.send('you viewed this page ' + req.session.views['/bar'] + ' times');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### User login

A simple example using `express-session` to keep a user log in session.

```javascript
var escapeHtml = require('escape-html');
var express = require('express');
var session = require('express-session');

var app = express();

app.use(
    session({
        secret: 'keyboard cat',
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: true
    })
);

// middleware to test if authenticated
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
    if (req.session.user) next();
    else next('route');
}

app.get('/', isAuthenticated, function (req, res) {
    // this is only called when there is an authentication user due to isAuthenticated
    res.send(
        'hello, ' +
            escapeHtml(req.session.user) +
            '!' +
            ' <a href="/logout">Logout</a>'
    );
});

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.send(
        '<form action="/login" method="post">' +
            'Username: <input name="user"><br>' +
            'Password: <input name="pass" type="password"><br>' +
            '<input type="submit" text="Login"></form>'
    );
});

app.post(
    '/login',
    express.urlencoded({ extended: false }),
    function (req, res) {
        // login logic to validate req.body.user and req.body.pass
        // would be implemented here. for this example any combo works

        // regenerate the session, which is good practice to help
        // guard against forms of session fixation
        req.session.regenerate(function (err) {
            if (err) next(err);

            // store user information in session, typically a user id
            req.session.user = req.body.user;

            // save the session before redirection to ensure page
            // load does not happen before session is saved
            req.session.save(function (err) {
                if (err) return next(err);
                res.redirect('/');
            });
        });
    }
);

app.get('/logout', function (req, res, next) {
    // logout logic

    // clear the user from the session object and save.
    // this will ensure that re-using the old session id
    // does not have a logged in user
    req.session.user = null;
    req.session.save(function (err) {
        if (err) next(err);

        // regenerate the session, which is good practice to help
        // guard against forms of session fixation
        req.session.regenerate(function (err) {
            if (err) next(err);
            res.redirect('/');
        });
    });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Debugging

This module uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module internally to log information about session operations.

To see all the internal logs, set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `express-session` when launching your app (`npm start`, in this example):

```sh
$ DEBUG=express-session npm start
```

On Windows, use the corresponding command;

```sh
> set DEBUG=express-session & npm start
```
