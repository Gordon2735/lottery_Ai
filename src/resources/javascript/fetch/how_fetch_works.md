The `fetch` API allows us to create a HTTP request so we accomplish a number of things in Javascriptâ€Š-â€Šlike retrieving data from an API, posting data to a server, or even just get the entire contents of a web page. This HTTP request will asynchronously retrieve data from the URL provided, and generate some kind of HTTP response. Let's look at how it works.

The `fetch()` function is a global function, and it is most frequently used to interact with APIs. If you're new to it, you're not alone - so let's take a look at how `fetch()` works.

## Using fetch in Javascript [#](https://fjolt.com/article/javascript-how-to-use-fetch#using-fetch-in-javascript)

The most basic use of fetch takes one argument - the URL we want to fetch. Since `fetch` generates HTTP requests, we always have to provide a URL:

```javascript
let fetchExample = fetch("https://fjolt.com").then((res) => {
 // Do something with res });
```

Since the result of a fetch is asynchronous, we can use `then()` to catch the response, and do something with it. The cool thing about the returned `res` or response is it has a bunch of built in methods, which let us immediately parse the contents we get from `fetch`:

-   `res.text()` - returns the text content of a URL. If it's a website, it returns the HTML.
-   `res.json()` - returns formatted JSON data, if it exists.
-   `res.blob()` - returns blob data, if any exists.
-   `res.arrayBuffer()` - returns arrayBuffer data, if any exists.
-   `res.formData()` - returns formData data, if any exists.

Since different URLs produce different types of content, the above methods allow us to parse that content in any way we like. To understand how that all works, let's look at two very common examples.

### Example 1: Get HTML content of a website using Javascript fetch

As mentioned above, `res.text()` gives us the text content of a URL - so we can use it to get the entire HTML content of a URL. Once we catch our response using `res.text()`, we can catch the response with another `then`, allowing us to download and return the content of the URL provided:

`let websiteData = fetch("https://fjolt.com").then(res => res.text()).then((data) => {
 return data; }); // Now contains our website's HTML.`

If the link doesn't exist, or an error occurs, our `response` object will contain an error. For example, a page not found will return `404`, or a bad gateway error will return `502`.

### Example 2: Get JSON via Javascript Fetch

If a URL's contents consist of JSON, we can use the `res.json()`. The following code, for example, will return a JSON object from the URL, assuming the URL is sending valid JSON back:

```javascript
let apiResponse = fetch('https://fjolt.com/api')
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
        return data;
    }); // Now contains a JSON object - assuming one exists
```

## Options for Javascript Fetch [#](https://fjolt.com/article/javascript-how-to-use-fetch#options-for-javascript-fetch)

It's also important to understand the options available in fetch,. They come after the URL, as an object - i.e. `fetch(URL, { options })`. If you've worked with HTTP requests before, some may be familiar. The `fetch` function displayed below contains all possible of the possible options you can use:

```javascript
fetch("https://fjolt.com/", {
 body: JSON.stringify({ someData: "value" }) method: 'POST' mode: 'cors' cache: 'no-cache' credentials: 'same-origin' headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, redirect: 'follow' referrerPolicy: 'no-referrer' });
```

And here is a summary of what each of these mean:

-   `body` contains the body of the text. In this example, we are sending some JSON, which needs to be stringified.
-   `method` is a standard HTTP method. It can be `POST`/`GET`/`DELETE`/`PUT`/`CONNECT`/`PATCH`/`TRACE`/`OPTIONS`.
-   `mode` refers to if cross origin requests are accepted. It can be `cors`/`no-cors`/`same-origin`.
-   `cache` refers to how the browser will interact with the cache. It can be `default`/`no-cache`/`reload`/`force-cache`/`only-if-cached`.
-   `credentials` refers to if cross origin cookies should be sent with the request. It can be `include`/`same-origin`/`omit`.
-   `headers` contains any header associated with the request. It can contain any HTTP header - for example, here it shows `Content-Type` - but you can have custom HTTP headers too.
-   `redirect` determines what happens if the fetched URL redirects. It can be `follow`/`error`/`manual`.
-   `referrerPolicy` determines how much referrer information is passed with the request. It can be `no-referrer`/`no-referrer-when-downgrade`/`origin`/`origin-when-cross-origin`/`same-origin`/`strict-origin`/`strict-origin-when-cross-origin`/`unsafe-url`.

## Remember, Javascript fetch is asynchronous [#](https://fjolt.com/article/javascript-how-to-use-fetch#remember,-javascript-fetch-is-asynchronous)

When we use fetch, it goes to the URL, gathers the information, and provides a `response` back to us. This is not immediate, since loading the URL, downloading it and bringing it back takes time. If we simply run fetch alone, a console log immediately after it will only return a `Promise`, not the `response` from the URL we want:

```javascript
let apiResponse = fetch('https://fjolt.com/api');
console.log(apiResponse); // Returns Promise<Pending>
```

This happens because the `fetch()` function runs, but Javascript **doesn't** wait for the `response`. As such, we have to explicitly tell Javascript to wait for it, if we want to access the `response`.

There are two ways to wait for `fetch()`:

-   We can use `then`, and manipulate the response of our `fetch()` within `then()`.
-   We can use `await`, and wait for the fetch to return before using its contents.

### Using then to wait for a fetch in Javascript

Using `then` is frequently used to catch and process responses from fetch. The contents of `fetch()` can be manipulated within the `then()` callback function, but not outside of it. For example:

```javascript
let apiResponse = fetch('https://fjolt.com/api')
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
        console.log(data); // We can do anything with the data from our api here.
        return data;
    });
console.log(apiResponse); // This will return Promise<Pending>
// That means we can't use the apiResponse variable // outside of the then() function.
```

If we want to use the contents from `fetch()` outside of `then`, we have to use `await`.

### Using await to wait for a fetch in Javascript

The other way to wait for a fetch is to use the `await` keyword. Most modern browsers support [Top level awaits](https://caniuse.com/?search=top%20level%20await), but if you are concerned about support, or using a version of Node.JS before 14.8, you'll want to wrap any `await` code within an `async function`.

If we use await, we can use the response from our API anywhere in our function or code, and use any `response` functions, like `text()` or `json()` on it. For example:

```javascript
// Typically we wrap await in an async function // But most modern browsers and Node.JS support // await statements outside of async functions now.
async getAPI() {
    let apiResponse = await fetch('https://fjolt.com/api');
    let response = apiResponse.json(); // Since we waited for our API to respond using await // The response variable will return the response from the API // And not a promise.
    console.log(response);
}
getAPI();
```

In this guide, we've gone through how fetch works. We've shown the different options you can send with your `fetch()` requests, and how to wait for the response using asynchronous concepts in Javascript. `fetch()` is an incredibly powerful tool in Javascript, and is used frequently in big products all the time.
