Embedding an image is very similar to adding a link in Markdown:

![Alt text](URL or file path)

Add an exclamation mark !
Followed by the alt text in square brackets [Alt text]
And the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses ( ).
For example:

![Sonny and Mariel high fiving.](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-cpp/community-challenge/highfive.gif)

The output would be:

Sonny and Mariel high fiving.

An optional title can also be added after the URL, still in the parentheses:

![Sonny and Mariel high fiving.](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-cpp/community-challenge/highfive.gif 'High Five')

Linked Images
To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.
