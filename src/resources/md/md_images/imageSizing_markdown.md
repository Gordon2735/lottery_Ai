# **Changing Image Size in Markdown**

I just got started with Markdown. I love it, but there is one thing bugging me: How can I change the size of an image using Markdown?

The documentation only gives the following suggestion for an image:

![drawing](drawing.jpg)
If it is possible I would like the picture to also be centered. I am asking for general Markdown, not just how GitHub does it.

For top image (like repo logo) I just make a "white padding" in original image before export to PNG. â€“

You could just use some HTML in your Markdown:

<img src="drawing.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
Or via style attribute (not supported by GitHub)

<img src="drawing.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:200px;"/>
Or you could use a custom CSS file as described in this answer on Markdown and image alignment

![drawing](drawing.jpg)
CSS in another file:

img[alt=drawing] { width: 200px; }

Using inline style does not work in most websites (e.g. GitHub) site it will get sanitized. Prefer width and height instead as mentioned by @kushdillip. â€“

@JulienColomb alt is always what's displayed as alternative for when the image can't load OR when the user can't see it. It does exactly the same thing. You're thinking of a separate attribute, title which makes hover text. Some browsers, if there's no title supplied, will display the alt text in both places. The accessibility complaint is valid. â€“

With certain Markdown implementations (including Mou and Marked 2 (only macOS)) you can append =WIDTHxHEIGHT after the URL of the graphic file to resize the image. Do not forget the space before the =.

![](./pic/pic1_50.png =100x20)
You can skip the HEIGHT

![](./pic/pic1s.png =250x)
And Width

![](./pic/pic1s.png =x250)

The accepted answer here isn't working with any Markdown editor available in the apps I have used till date like Ghost, Stackedit.io or even in the StackOverflow editor. I found a workaround here in the StackEdit.io issue tracker.

The solution is to directly use HTML syntax, and it works perfectly:

<img src="http://....jpg" width="200" height="200" />

Note that on Stack Exchange sites you must use this exact format, and no other attributes (note even alt) are seemingly allowed (you may omit width or height, and the space before /> is optional, but other than that no extra whitespace is allowed). GitHub, by contrast, supports (at least) also alt and title attributes, and allows extra whitespace. â€“

On Stack Overflow, the simple solution is to link to a different version of the picture. Each image you upload gets rendered in six different versions, which you can switch between by adding a character to indicate the desired size before the .png extension. For details, see meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/253403/â€¦ â€“

Combining two answers I came out with a solution, that might not look that pretty,
but it works!

It creates a thumbnail with a specific size that might be clicked to bring you to the max resolution image.

[<img src="image.png" width="250"/>](image.png)
Here's an example! I tested it on Visual Code and Github. Example markdown

Thanks to the feedback, we know that this also works on:

If you are writing MarkDown for PanDoc, you can do this:

![drawing](drawing.jpg){ width=50% }
This adds style="width: 50%;" to the HTML <img> tag, or [width=0.5\textwidth] to \includegraphics in LaTeX.

Maybe this has recently changed but the Kramdown docs show a simple solution.

From the docs

Here is an inline ![smiley](smiley.png){:height="36px" width="36px"}.

And here is a referenced ![smile]

[smile]: smile.png

{: height="36px" width="36px"}
Works on github with Jekyll and Kramdown.

Block attributes as shown here are a good option with kramdown. The syntax here is slightly wrong, which may be why @piratemurray is having trouble. It should be {: height=36 width=36}; this generates HTML attributes, so it should not have the px suffix. Alternately, you can use css with {: style="height:36px; width:36px"}. â€“

One might draw on the alt attribute that can be set in almost all Markdown implementations/renderes together with CSS-selectors based on attribute values. The advantage is that one can easily define a whole set of different picture sizes (and further attributes).

Markdown:

![minipic](mypic.jpg)
CSS:

img[alt="minipic"] {
max-width: 20px;
display: block;
}

Yes, it is a hack BUT still seems to be the only thing that works across Markdown flavors. +1 for pointing that out (people using screen readers get problems with that right? They will get also problems with all those not bothering with using alt the right way). â€“

If you are using kramdown, you can do this:

![drawing](drawing.jpg)
Then add this to your Custom CSS:

.foo {
text-align: center;
width: 100px;
}

I would recommend against setting the width only in CSS. It is useful to tell the browser how large the image element will be before the image and stylesheet are done loading so that it can optimize the layout of elements around the image without doing a reflow. â€“

Building on from Tiemes answer, if you're using CSS 3 you can use a substring selector:

This selector will match any image with an alt tag that ends with '-fullwidth':

img[alt$="-fullwidth"]{
width: 100%;
display: block;
}
Then you can still use the alt tag for its intended purpose to describe the image.

The Markdown for the above could be something like:

![Picture of the Beach -fullwidth](beach.jpg)
I've been using this in Ghost markdown, and it has been working well.

If you are using reference style images in GitHub Flavored Markdown:

Here is an image of tree:
![alt text][tree]{height=400px width=500px}

[//]: # 'Image References'
[tree]: ./images/tree.png 'This is a tree'

For those intereseted in an rmarkdown and knitr solution. There are some ways to resize images in an .rmd file without the use of html:

You can simply specify a width for an image by adding {width=123px}. Don't introduce whitespace in between the brackets:

![image description]('your-image.png'){width=250px}
Another option is to use knitr::include_graphics:

```{r, fig.cap="image description", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('your-image.png')
```

If you have one image in each md file, one handy way to control image size is:

adding css style as follows:

## Who Invented JSON?

`Douglas Crockford`

Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format in the early 2000s.
![Douglas Crockford](img/Douglas_Crockford.jpg)

<style type="text/css">
    img {
        width: 250px;
    }
</style>

and the output will be like: enter image description here

If you have more images in each md page, then the handy way to control each image or each customized tag is to define each element in css. For this case for the img tag we could have:

//in css or within style tags:
img[alt="Result1"] {
width: 100px;
}

    img[alt="Result2"] {
    width: 200px;
    }
    img[alt="Result3"] {
    width: 400px;
    }

// try in md one of the methods shown below to insert image in your document:
<br/>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xUb54.png" alt="Result1"> <br/>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xUb54.png" alt="Result2"> <br/>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xUb54.png" alt="Result3"> <br/>

<br/>

in md:<br/>
![Result1](img/res-img-1.png) <br/>

![Result2](img/res-img-2.png) <br/>

![Result3](img/res-img-3.png)

I came here searching for an answer. Some awesome suggestions here. And gold information pointing out that markdown supports HTMl completely!

A good clean solution is always to go with pure html syntax for sure. With the tag.

But I was trying to still stick to the markdown syntax so I tried wrapping it around a tag and added whatever attributes i wanted for the image inside the div tag. And it WORKS!!

<div style="width:50%">![Chilling](https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/fjords.jpg)</div>
So this way external images are supported!

Just thought I would put this out there as it isn't in any of the answers. :)

For all looking for solutions which work in R markdown/ bookdown, these of the previous solutions do/do not work or need slight adaption:

Working
Append { width=50% } or { width=50% height=50% }

![foo](foo.png){ width=50% }
![foo](foo.png){ width=50% height=50% }

Important: no comma between width and height â€“ i.e. { width=50%, height=30% } won't work!

Append { height="36px" width="36px" }

![foo](foo.png){ height="36px" width="36px" }
Note: {:height="36px" width="36px"} with colon, as from @sayth, seems not to work with R markdown
Not working:
Append =WIDTHxHEIGHT
after the URL of the graphic file to resize the image (as from @prosseek)
neither =WIDTHxHEIGHT ![foo](foo.png =100x20) nor =WIDTH only ![foo](foo.png =250x) work

Not a universal solution, but if you're working in Obsidian it has its own syntax for this:

![Engelbart|100x145](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)
Or, to use the example from the question:

![drawing|200x100](drawing.jpg)

You could use this one as well with kramdown:

markdown
![drawing](drawing.jpg)  
{:.some-css-class style="width: 200px"}
or

markdown
![drawing](drawing.jpg)  
{:.some-css-class width="200"}
This way you can directly add arbitrary attributes to the last html element. To add classes there is a shortcut .class.secondclass.

I know that this answer is a bit specific, but it might help others in need.

As many photos are uploaded using the Imgur service, you can use the API detailed here to change the size of the photo.

When uploading a photo in a GitHub issue comment, it will be added through Imgur, so this will help a lot if the photo is very big.

Basically, instead of https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y682Q.gif, you would put http://i.imgur.com/12345m.jpg for medium sized image.

I scripted the simple tag parser for using a custom-size img tag in Jekyll.

https://gist.github.com/nurinamu/4ccf7197a1bdfb0d7079

{% img /path/to/img.png 100x200 %}

For those using Markdown on Google Colaboratory, there is no need to have the image uploaded to the session storage folder, or linked on Google Drive. If the image has a URL, and it can be included on the Jupyter notebook, and its size changed as follows:

<img src="https://image.png" width="500" height="500" />
enter image description here

Note that entering just the width leaving the height completely out allows the image to adjust to small screens (i.e. phone).

For R-Markdown, neither of the above solutions worked for me, so I turned to regular LaTeX syntax, which works just fine.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=300pt, height = 125 pt]{drawing.jpg}
\end{figure}
Then you can use e.g. the \begin{center} statement to center the image.

+1, but better just \centering after \begin{figure} or nothing, if you use ` \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{drawing.jpg}` that I think that should be the default pandoc output at least when the image is wider that the text. â€“

Resizing Markdown Image Attachments in Jupyter Notebook
I'm using jupyter_core-4.4.0 & jupyter notebook.

If you're attaching your images by inserting them into the markdown like this:
![Screen%20Shot%202019-08-06%20at%201.48.10%20PM.png](attachment:Screen%20Shot%202019-08-06%20at%201.48.10%20PM.png)
These attachment links don't work:
<img src="attachment:Screen%20Shot%202019-08-06%20at%201.48.10%20PM.png" width="500"/>
DO THIS. This does work.
Just add div brackets.

<div>
<img src="attachment:Screen%20Shot%202019-08-06%20at%201.48.10%20PM.png" width="500"/>
</div>
Hope this helps!

When using Flask (I am using it with flat pages)... I found that enabling explicitly (was not by default for some reason) 'attr_list' in extensions within the call to markdown does the trick - and then one can use the attributes (very useful also to access CSS - class="my class" for example...).

FLATPAGES_HTML_RENDERER = prerender_jinja

and the function:

def prerender_jinja(text):
prerendered_body = render_template_string(Markup(text))
pygmented_body = markdown.markdown(prerendered_body, extensions=['codehilite', 'fenced_code', 'tables', 'attr_list'])
return pygmented_body
And then in Markdown:

![image](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png 'This is a tooltip'){: width=200px}

The addition of relative dimensions to the source URL will be rendered in the majority of Markdown renderers.

We implemented this in Corilla as I think the pattern is one that follows expectations of existing workflows without pushing the user to rely on basic HTML. If your favourite tool doesn't follow a similar pattern it's worth raising a feature request.

Example of syntax:

![a-kitten.jpg](//corilla.com/a-kitten-2xU3C2.jpg =200x200)

Example of kitten:

kitten

For future reference:

Markdown implementation for Joplin allows controlling the size of imported images in the following manner:

<img src=":/7653a812439451eb1803236687a70ca" width="450"/>

This feature was requested here and as promised by Laurent this has been implemented.

It took me a while to figure the Joplin specific answer.

Via plain backward compatible MD:

![<alt>](<imguri>#<w>x<h> "<title>")
where w, h defines the bounding box to aspect fit into, as eg in Flutter package https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown

Code: https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/9e8f5227ac14026c419f481ed1dfcb7b53961475/packages/flutter_markdown/lib/src/builder.dart#L473

Reconsider html workarounds breaking compatibility as people might use native/non-html components/apps to display markdown.

Put the image URL in tag below. Remember to change the width and height accordingly. Like This

<img src="IMAGE_URL_HERE"  width="300" height="300">
You can specify width without height attribute and vice versa.

Alternatively, you can change image size using percentage value like below:

<img src="IMAGE_URL_HERE"  width=50% height=50%>

I just got started with Markdown. I love it, but there is one thing bugging me: How can I change the size of an image using Markdown?

The documentation only gives the following suggestion for an image:

![drawing](drawing.jpg)
If it is possible I would like the picture to also be centered. I am asking for general Markdown, not just how GitHub does it.

For top image (like repo logo) I just make a "white padding" in original image before export to PNG. â€“

The sheer <img ... width="50%"> said above, did work on my Github Readme.md document.

However my real issue was, that the image was inside a table cell, just compressing the text in the beside cell. So the other way was to set columns width in Markdown tables, but the solutions did not really seem enough markdownish for my morning.

At last I solved both problems by simply forcing the beside text cell with as much "& nbsp;" as I needed.

I hope this helps. Bye and thanks everybody.

If we just use normal HTML image tag like this it is working, if you use bootstrap for styling. I use this in website made with Jekyll.

<img class="img-fluid" src="./img/face.jpg" alt="img-verification">
If we add bootstrap classes as per this example it works fine.

If changing the initial markdown is not an option for you, this hack might work:

newHtml = oldHtml.replace(/<img/g, '<img height="100"');
I used this to be able to resize images before sending them in an email (as Outlook ignores any image css styling)

Well, some of us do not like warnings. Those warnings come from Markdown linting. So there are two things you need to do:

Use in-line html:
Instead of using: ![drawing](drawing.jpg)

use: <img src="Assets/icon.png" width=250 height=200>

250 and 200 being the preferred width and height of your image, respectively! You can choose to use only one attribute and ignore the other.

Bring down the warnings:
At the root of your project, create a .markdownlint.json file with the following contents:
{
"MD033": false,
"MD013": false
}
To suppress the warnings. Add other warnings you'd like to suppress here!

This will work

<style>
img{width: 50%;}
#foo {color: red;}
</style>

<p id="foo">foo</p>

<p style="color: blue">bar</p>

If you are using markdown-it, first you need to enable HTML render:

const md = require("markdown-it")({
html: true,
});
then you can use in your .md file:

<img src="" alt="drawing" width="100%" height="200"/>

Tieme's answer is best for most cases.

In my case, I am using pandoc to convert markdown to latex. HTML tags won't work here.

My solution is to re-implement \includegraphics

\let\maxincludegraphics\includegraphics
\renewcommand{\includegraphics}[1]{\maxincludegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{#1}}
The is analogous to using CSS after a conversion to HTML.

I would just edit the image in some image editor - enlarge the image horizontally, therefore it will get smaller vertically when resized by the renderer to the width of the page.

So, just add some transparent left and right margins.

You can set size at the end of the image like this:

![image.png](source **=600x400**)
