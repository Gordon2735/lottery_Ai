# **How State Management works**

**_Dead simple SM in Vanilla JavaScript_**

Dead simple State Management in Vanilla JavaScript
It's been years now since you started using Redux, MobX or even plain React Hooks and have no idea how state management works and why it works the way it works? I'll show you the dead simple bottom level of work in state management sans any optimization or other bells and whistles.

We will be building a stupidly simple plain ol' HTML page with script tags in it.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>State Management in Vanilla JS</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<div id="app"></div>

		<script>
			//
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

**_Now let's write some JavaScript_**

NOTE: TL;DR; is down below ‚è¨

```javascript
const App = function \_App() {
 return `     <h1>Hello Vanilla JS</h1>
    <div>Example of state management in Vanilla JS</div>
  `;
}
document.getElementById("app").innerHTML = App();
//I could have simply declared as
const App = function() { // ...
// or
const App = () => { // ...
But there's reason I didn't, which I'll explain later. Now, let's create some state
App.state = {
count: 0,
increment: () => {
App.state.count++;
}
};
```

A simple state created as a property on App function. üòâ

Wait! You can do that? üò≤

Yes, everything in JavaScript is an object, and technically you can even do that on strings and numbers. That is why methods like "hello world".toUppercase() and (12).toFixed(2) would work. But the compiler doesn't allow you to define your own properties on a string or number.

Now that App has been made stateful, we shall integrate the state and add a click event listener at the end of file.

```html
<h1>`${_App.state.count}`</h1>
<button id="button">Increase</button>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = App();
// On Click Function
document
	.getElementById('button')
	.addEventListener('click', App.state.increment);
// Note that I'm accessing App inside itself by neither this nor by App but by \_App. This is called as "Named function expression"

// There are two special things about Named function expression:

// It allows the function to reference itself internally.
// It is not visible outside of the function.
// Even if I do something like this below, the code won't break.
const Component = App;
App = null;
document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = Component();
// Even when App has been reassigned to Component and then made to be null, the function itself remains intact and it refers itself as \_App locally, // hence it is not affected. Same as 'this' in every other OOP programming language (But We all know how this works in JavaScript)üòÖ.

// Now try running it (simply double click the index.html file). Notice that the on click function isn't working! üôÑ It's because the UI is not reflecting the latest state, let's fix that by re-rendering the elements. This can be done by running this code again when the state is updated.
document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = App();
// On Click Function
document
	.getElementById('button')
	.addEventListener('click', App.state.increment);
// Since this code is and will be repeated, we will extract it to a function
const updateTree = () => {
	document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = App();
	// On Click Function
	document
		.getElementById('button')
		.addEventListener('click', App.state.increment);
};
// Now add a setState function
const setState = (callback) => {
	callback();
	updateTree(); // extracted function
};
// and update the increment function as
increment: () => {
	// Call our set state function
	setState(() => App.state.count++);
};
```

Now our App works as expected. And that's it! that's the end of Dead simple State Management in Vanilla JavaScript. However just using as it is would be consider as an awful and poor framework, not because of its lack of any bell and whistles worthy feature, but because it is poorly optimized, in fact it has no optimization, but you already know this when I said "‚Ä¶sans any optimization or other bells and whistles" in the beginning of this article.

Things to do,

Should not render the whole application to reflect a simple change.
As soon as we update to reflect the state, all the event listeners attached to DOM should not be lost and we shouldn't add new event listeners in its place.
The DOM elements that were unaffected and unchanged by state should not be forced to change. Changes should be as small as possible
So we shall few optimizations to our App like how React and similar library / framework does in the next upcoming article.

TL;DR;
Here is the full HTML file we have coded so far.

Sferrazza ‚Ä¢ May 7 '23 Really into this, thank you for sharing! The cognitive
burden of many frameworks is too high for what one gets in return. I've found
this routine to be helpful for rendering the state of arbitrary objects to the
DOM. Additionally, when using standard HTML template tags, I've used another
routine to populate slots (template parameters) and render the template at
runtime. 1 like Like Reply squashbugler profile image John Grisham ‚Ä¢ Mar 16 '21

Viridi ‚Ä¢ Mar 12 '21 ‚Ä¢ Edited on Mar 12 First of all great post Vijay! artydev is
right about the fact that the code could be optimized but Matt is also right.
Adding a library does not optimize this piece of code. Having a look at the code
there is only one thing that changes and that is text in the last h1 tag. So if
you want to optimize this code why not do it like this? ```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>State Management in Vanilla JS</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello Vanilla JS!</h1>
		<div>Example of state management in Vanilla JS</div>
		<br />
		<h1 id="app"></h1>
		<button id="button">Increase</button>
		<script>
			const App = function _App() {
				return _App.state.count;
			};

			App.state = {
				count: 0,
				increment: () => {
					App.state.count++;
					App.state.updateUI();
				},
				updateUI: () => {
					document.getElementById('app').textContent = App();
				}
			};
			App.state.updateUI();
			document
				.getElementById('button')
				.addEventListener('click', App.state.increment);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
``` There is no need to add the event listener on every update and there is no
need to rerender the rest of the html on every update. Just update the text in
the h1 tag and minimize the rerendering needs. If you want to build the html
from javascript you can render the html just once on initialization. 1 like Like

No problem artydev. You can of course always fall back on a library when you
have a lot of re-rendering going on. I believe that to make the right decision
you need to understand what is going on under the hood. There are a lot of
tutorials on diffing and VDom to be found on the internet for those interested.
