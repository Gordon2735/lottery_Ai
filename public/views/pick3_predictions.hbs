                        indexed in time order. It involves analyzing the patterns of past data points to 
                        predict future values. Common models include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving 
                        Average) and exponential smoothing.

                        to learn from and make predictions based on data. Techniques like regression 
                        analysis, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks could be employed
                        to identify patterns and make predictions.

                        These are mathematical methods used to find the best possible solution or outcome.
                        Techniques such as linear programming, integer programming, and dynamic programming
                        can be used to optimize predictions.

                        This is a computational algorithm that relies on repeated random sampling to 
                        obtain numerical results. It can be used to model the probability of different 
                        outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention 
                        of random variables.

                        As you've mentioned, actuaries use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory 
                        to study uncertain future events. The methods used by actuaries, such as survival
                        analysis and risk modeling, can be adapted to forecast lottery numbers.
